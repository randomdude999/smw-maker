Building everything:
1. Go to applier/ and build it (either using make on linux or by just building the solution with VS on windows).
2. Go to baserom/ and build that. There's a README there with instructions.

Setting up webserver:
1. Get MySQL and PHP.
2. Build everything.
3. Copy the MWLApplier.exe generated by the build to the main repo directory (the one with this README).
4. In your webserver's root directory, create a symlink to the webserver folder here.
5. In MySQL, create a database named smwmaker, and run db_schema.sql in there. If you set a password for it, don't forget to update webserver/common_includes.php's db_connect function.
