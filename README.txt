Stuff you need to properly run this:
a webserver with php
mysql
python? waitno, not anymore
ability to compile c++ code
windows (for building baserom, everything else should work on linux too. nvm, if you write your own buildscripts and use the linux build of asar, you can build the baserom on linux too)
